#data frame
#matrix

#4. Question 4
#If I execute the expression x <- 4 in R, what is the class of the object `x' as determined by the `class()' function?
#numeric
#
#5. Question 5
#What is the class of the object defined by x <- c(4, TRUE)?
#numeric
#
#6. Question 6
#If I have two vectors x <- c(1,3, 5) and y <- c(3, 2, 10), what is produced by the expression rbind(x, y)?
#(rbind-row,cbind-column)
#a matrix with two rows and three columns
#
#7. Question 7
#A key property of vectors in R is that
#elements of a vector all must be of the same class
#
#8. Question 8
#Suppose I have a list defined as x <- list(2, "a", "b", TRUE). What does x[[1]] give me? Select all that apply.
#a list containing a numeric vector of length 1
#a numeric vector containing the element 2
#
#9. Question 9
#Suppose I have a vector x <- 1:4 and y <- 2:3. What is produced by the expression x + y?
#an integer vector with the values 3, 5, 5, 7
#
#10. Question 10
#Suppose I have a vector x <- c(17, 14, 4, 5, 13, 12, 10) and I want to set all elements of this vector that are greater than 10 to be equal to 4. What R code achieves this? Select all that apply.
#x[x > 10] <- 4
#x[x >= 11] <- 4
#
#11. Question 11
#Use the Week 1 Quiz Data Set to answer questions 11-20.
#In the dataset provided for this Quiz, what are the column names of the dataset?

data1<-file('hw1_data.csv')
air<-read.csv(data1)
names(air)

#
#12. Question 12
#Extract the first 2 rows of the data frame and print them to the console. What does the output look like?

head(air,2)

#
#13. Question 13
#How many observations (i.e. rows) are in this data frame?

nrow(air)

#
#14. Question 14
#Extract the last 2 rows of the data frame and print them to the console. What does the output look like?

tail(air,2)

#
#15. Question 15
#What is the value of Ozone in the 47th row?

air$Ozone[47]

#
#16. Question 16
#How many missing values are in the Ozone column of this data frame?

sum(is.na(air$Ozone))

#
#17. Question 17
#What is the mean of the Ozone column in this dataset? Exclude missing values (coded as NA) from this calculation.

mean(air$Ozone[!is.na(air$Ozone)])

#
#18. Question 18
#Extract the subset of rows of the data frame where Ozone values are above 31 and Temp values are above 90. What is the mean of Solar.R in this subset?

mean(subset(air,Ozone>31&Temp>90)$Solar.R[!is.na(subset(air,Ozone>31&Temp>90)$Solar.R)])

#
#19. Question 19

#
#20. Question 20
#What was the maximum ozone value in the month of May (i.e. Month is equal to 5)?

max(subset(air,Month==5)$Ozone[!is.na(subset(air,Month==5)$Ozone)])
